# Rainbow Bridge (彩虹橋)

One of the great things about living in Taipei is its hundreds of kilometers of riverside parks, which offer something for people of all ages. In addition, from select spots, they provide fantastic viewing for riverside sunsets. 

Up in Songshan, conveniently right next to the classic Raohe Night Market, is the Rainbow Bridge, situated nicely along a beautiful riverside park. At all times of the day, but especially in the evening, this place gets filled with people. You can view the sunset from multiple places. Some choose to utilize the many benches next to the water. You can just snap shots from the bike/walking path on either side of the river. Depending on the sky, the sun might be obstructed by other bridges and buildings in the foreground. No worries; you can also take pictures from the bridge itself for a higher angle.

The cool thing about this area is that it sits at a part of the Keelung River that turns northwest, so you have a chance to see the sunset and its rays shining across that part of the river. 

The paths filled with pedestrians on either side of the river, the curves, the shadows, and at dusk, rainbow colors from the bridge and from street lamps make pictures from here jam-packed with detail and perspective. 

Rainbow Bridge is easily accessible via public transport. The bridge is at the entrance to the entrance to the riverside park just a few minutes walk from Songshan Station. There is limited street parking in that area.
